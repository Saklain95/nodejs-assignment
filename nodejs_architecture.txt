Node.js architecture is built on the **event-driven, non-blocking I/O model**. It uses the **V8 JavaScript engine** to execute code and the **libuv library** to handle asynchronous operations. The architecture consists of a single-threaded event loop that manages multiple client requests efficiently. When a request is received, it is processed asynchronously, allowing the server to handle other requests simultaneously. This makes Node.js highly scalable and suitable for real-time applications. The architecture also includes modules for file system operations, networking, and other functionalities, making it a versatile platform for server-side development.advantages of itHere are some advantages of Node.js:Asynchronous and Event-Driven: Node.jsuses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it efficient and suitable for real-time applications that require high performance and scalability.
